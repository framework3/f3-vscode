# f3-lang README

framework3 is a new way to write web applications, combining several concepts at once:

* Creating an application with frontend and backend components in a coherent language
* Shipping the production runtime as the dev runtime (one and the same, except for exception handling)
* Scale by spinning up new processes and calling it a day
* A robust type system that can handle complex nested data objects
* A built-in hybrid database engine for storing documents with unique IDs
* Developer tooling (like this plugin!) to make f3 a little easier to work with.
